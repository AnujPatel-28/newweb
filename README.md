*   **Immersive Hero Experience**: A dynamic entry point featuring staggered animations, mouse-responsive elements, and a "living" brand watermark.
*   **Glassmorphic Design System**: A sophisticated UI language using `backdrop-blur`, deep gradients, and frosted glass elements (`bg-white/20`) for a futuristic feel.
*   **Interactive Data Visualization**: Complex animations using **Framer Motion** to visualize orbit networks, node synchronization, and live status updates.
*   **High-End Micro-Interactions**: Hover states, magnetic elements, and scroll-triggered reveals that make the application feel alive.
*   **Fully Responsive**: optimized for everything from 4K ultrawide monitors to mobile devices.
